on long-term value creation. Samsara believes that innovation and meaningful patient impact will drive attractive risk-adjusted
returns, and that the time scale for this value accretion parallels the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics.
It invests in both public and private biopharmaceutical companies across all financing rounds from seed to crossover to initial
public offering, private investments in public equity (PIPEs) and follow-on offerings. It is agnostic with respect to development
stage and therapeutic area with current investments ranging from an early-stage incubator, focused on facilitating the advancement
of academic research, to public companies with marketed products. Samsara invests in companies in the U.S. as well as other global
markets.</P>

over 1,000 private and public biopharmaceutical companies, investing in 45 private and public companies in various financing rounds.
As of August&nbsp;30, 2020, 10 out of the 45 companies had completed initial public offerings and one company had announced its
acquisition. Representative investments by Samsara include Allakos (Nasdaq: ALLK), Chinook Therapeutics, Dewpoint Therapeutics,

Graphite Bio and Tentarix Biotherapeutics. Samsara has also been instrumental in the creation of an early stage incubator called
Autobahn Labs. Autobahn Labs collaborates with scientists at leading academic institutions to accelerate the translation of scientific
ideas to novel therapeutics.</P>

pathophysiology of a particular disease state, the rationale of a proposed therapeutic target, detailed understanding of the proposed
therapeutic modality and clinical development program, regulatory requirements for product approval and the end-market clinical
and commercial opportunity, including market access and reimbursement. These factors are integrated to develop an investment thesis
focused on intrinsic value and a capital formation plan to achieve significant milestones. Critical to the investment process
is the identification of specific management talent that can successfully develop and commercialize the company&rsquo;s products.
Samsara is an active investor with significant operating and board experience in guiding companies through the drug discovery

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">The last decade has seen unprecedented innovation
in the biopharmaceutical industry, including the introduction of a multitude of new therapies for serious diseases and the establishment
of new therapeutic modalities. These innovations have resulted in significant advances for clinicians and patients, and markedly
improved the outcomes for patients suffering from a wide range of diseases. Among the most significant advances during this period
was the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents that leverage a patient&rsquo;s immune system to fight their disease. These
medications have become the backbone treatment for many cancers and were led by the approvals by the U.S. FDA of Yervoy (2011)
and Keytruda (2014). In the years since the first approvals, a number of additional agents have been approved and a large number
are currently in clinical trials. In 2013, a functional cure for patients suffering from specific types of the hepatitis C virus
was approved by the U.S. FDA. The industry also saw the first cell and gene therapy products approved by the U.S. FDA this decade,
with the approval and launches of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for cancer and gene therapies for a genetic form
of blindness and spinal muscular atrophy (&ldquo;SMA&rdquo;), an orphan disease characterized by neuromuscular issues and early
death.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">These new medicines and modalities represent
the culmination of decades of basic science research and significant advances in our understanding of disease pathophysiology as
well as the advancement in manufacturing techniques for these new therapeutic approaches. The advances in our understanding of
the underlying causes of disease have been facilitated by significant improvements in the cost, speed, and accuracy of tools that
allow researchers to identify the specific genetic, genomic, and cellular aberrations associated with disease. This has enabled
better identification of biological targets as well as facilitated broader use of biomarkers as surrogate biological indicators
of efficacy in clinical development, allowing researchers to refine and enhance clinical trial designs, and direct treatments to
the patients that will benefit most.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">This innovation has been supported, and indeed
accelerated, by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA which have utilized a number of tools to catalyze the introduction of new
medicines to physicians and patients. The U.S. FDA, and similar agencies in other territories, has established a number of regulatory
tools that allow biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate the drug development process and the advancement of new therapies to
patients. These regulatory tools include orphan drug designation which provides defined regulatory exclusivity for products targeting
under 200,000 patients in the U.S., fast track designation which decreases the FDA review time from 10 months to 6 months, accelerated
approval which allows for the approval of new medicines based on surrogate markers of efficacy, priority review and breakthrough
designation which provides additional access and interaction to the FDA for diseases with high unmet medical needs. From 2014 to
2019, the U.S. FDA approved 261 new molecular entities (NMEs), with 46% of approvals receiving orphan drug designation, 65% receiving
priority review, 15% receiving accelerated approval, and 26% designated as breakthrough therapies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">Largely based on the confluence of scientific
innovation, regulatory alignment and patient need, the pace of private company formation as well as IPOs has been very strong.
From 2018 to 2019, there were over 850 private biopharmaceutical financing rounds in the U.S. and EU raising over $32 billion in
proceeds. During the same period, there were 99 biopharmaceutical IPOs in the US and EU raising over $12 billion in proceeds. Despite
the recent volume of IPOs, the process of &ldquo;going public&rdquo; is replete with myriad challenges that are specific to the
biopharmaceutical industry and results in significant inefficiencies in the biopharmaceutical equity markets. This includes the
need for a private biotech company management team to assemble their own syndicate of sophisticated investors who are able to understand
the complex scientific, clinical and regulatory factors needed for creating successful medicines. We believe that key to the successful
growth and maturation of a biopharmaceutical company is to reduce its cost of capital, diversify its shareholder base, and increase
its visibility in the broader healthcare ecosystem through access to the public markets. The additional capital available in the
public markets allows companies to advance products through more advanced stages of the drug development and regulatory process,
and potentially to eventual commercialization, leading to significant value inflections in their market capitalization and shareholder
returns.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">We believe that this universe of private
companies is fertile ground for accessing the public markets via a business combination with our company. In addition to existing
private companies, large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies continue to evolve their therapeutic focus and strategies leading
to rationalization of their product portfolios. We believe that this pool of rationalized assets also represents an attractive
pool of acquisition candidates. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage these market inefficiencies to identify high
value assets that are under appreciated by the broader investment community. Our management team and Board, combined with Samsara&rsquo;s
expertise, network and premier deal flow, provide us with unparalleled visibility across all stages of biopharmaceutical companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">The biopharmaceutical industry has also benefited
significantly from a continued need for larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to build their pipelines of drugs via
mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). There are many drivers of M&amp;A activity in the biopharmaceutical industry, including significant
loss of revenues due to patent expirations and the need to access next generation technologies to drive future growth. Since the
beginning of 2017, there have been over 80 M&amp;A transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry with transaction value greater
than $500 million each, resulting in a cumulative M&amp;A volume of nearly $500 billion. Industry analysts predict that M&amp;A
activity is expected to continue as biopharmaceutical companies continue to face patent expirations and depend on acquisitions
to drive innovation and growth. Since 2019, there have been a number of M&amp;A transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry
with transaction value greater than $1 billion. A few recent examples include Bristol-Myers Squibb&rsquo;s acquisition of Celgene
for $74 billion, Eli Lilly&rsquo;s acquisition of LOXO Oncology for $8 billion, and Gilead&rsquo;s acquisition of Forty Seven for
$4.9 billion. In addition, recently announced M&amp;A transactions with transaction value greater than $1 billion that recently
closed or are expected to close soon include Sanofi&rsquo;s acquisition of Principia Biopharma for $3.7 billion, Johnson &amp;
Johnson&rsquo;s acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5 billion, Gilead&rsquo;s acquisition of Immunomedics for $21 billion
and Illumina&rsquo;s acquisition of GRAIL for $8 billion and Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s acquisition of MyoKardia for $13 billion.</P>

and acquiring an innovative biopharmaceutical company, in-licensing promising assets from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
or combining target companies with additional assets to create critical mass in a therapeutic area. We believe our management team
working alongside Samsara is uniquely positioned to identify potential acquisition targets, and our collective reach and reputation
in the industry will make us a preferred partner. Our dedicated management team puts us in a unique position, if needed, to take
operating or board roles and help position the merged company for success following the business combination. We believe that our

purchase of up to 2,500,000 forward purchase shares in a private placement that may close simultaneously with the closing of our
initial business combination. Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s commitment under the forward purchase agreement is subject to, among other
conditions, the business combination (including the target assets or business, and the terms of the business combination) being
reasonably acceptable to Samsara BioCapital. This purchase will be eligible to be made regardless of whether any shares of Class
A common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders. The forward purchase shares will be issued only in connection with the
closing of the initial business combination. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase shares, if any, may be used as part
of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination
or for working capital in the post-transaction company. See &ldquo;&mdash;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Nasdaq rules require that we must complete
one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the
trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors will
make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to
independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market
value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of
a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target&rsquo;s assets or prospects.</P>

opportunity jointly with our sponsor, Samsara BioCapital or one or more of its affiliates, the Samsara Fund and/or investors in
the Samsara Fund, which we refer to as an Affiliated Joint Acquisition. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business
at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to
such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a
fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant
to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B common stock, issuances or deemed issuances of Class A common stock or equity-linked
securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class
A common stock such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage
ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of this offering plus
all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination
(excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the
holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such
issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Neither our sponsor, nor Samsara BioCapital nor any of their respective affiliates,
has an obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential business combinations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We anticipate structuring our initial business
combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that
the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet
certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition,
as described above. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50%
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment
Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders
prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations
ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue
a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire
a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders
immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our
initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned
or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will
be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than
one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.</P>

        of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. On October 30,

        $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined
        by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. The number of founder shares
        outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of this offering would be a maximum of 11,500,000 shares
        if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full, and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20%
        of the outstanding shares after this offering (and without giving effect to the issuance of private placement shares). Up to 375,000
        of the founder shares will be subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option

        <P>Subsequent to this offering, our sponsor intends to transfer 30,000 of our Class B common stock to each of our independent

If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target&rsquo;s assets or prospects. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete our initial business combination if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock or shares of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable.</TD></TR>

    <TD>Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder&rsquo;s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering) for or against our initial business combination.</TD></TR>

forward purchase shares, the post-transaction company may not have enough cash available for working capital. The obligations
under the forward purchase agreement do not depend on whether any public stockholders elect to redeem their shares in connection
with our initial business combination. However, if the sale of the forward purchase shares does not close, for example, by reason
of the failure of Samsara BioCapital or any forward transferee to fund the purchase price for their forward purchase shares, we
may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination. Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s obligation to purchase forward
purchase shares will, among other things, be conditioned on the business combination (including the target assets or business,
and the terms of the business combination) being reasonably acceptable to Samsara BioCapital and on a requirement that such initial
business combination is approved by a unanimous vote of our Board of Directors. In determining whether a target is reasonably
acceptable to Samsara BioCapital, we expect that Samsara BioCapital would consider many of the same criteria as we will consider,
but will also consider whether the investment is an appropriate investment for Samsara BioCapital. Accordingly, if we pursue an
acquisition target that is not reasonably acceptable to Samsara BioCapital, or if the initial business combination is not approved
by a unanimous vote of our Board of Directors, Samsara BioCapital would not be obligated to purchase any forward purchase shares,
and we may need to seek alternative financing. Additionally, Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s and any forward transferee&rsquo;s obligations
to purchase the forward purchase shares will be subject to termination prior to the closing of the sale of such securities by
mutual written consent of the Company and such party, or automatically: (i) if this offering is not consummated on or prior to
December 31, 2020; (ii) if our initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months from the closing of this offering,
unless extended up to a maximum of sixty (60) days in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; or
(iii) if we become subject to any voluntary or involuntary petition under the United States federal bankruptcy laws or any state
insolvency law, in each case which is not withdrawn within sixty (60) days after being filed, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar
officer is appointed by a court for business or property of us, in each case which is not removed, withdrawn or terminated within
sixty (60) days after such appointment. In addition, Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s obligations to purchase the forward purchase shares
will be subject to fulfilment of customary closing conditions, including that our initial business combination must be consummated
substantially concurrently with the purchase of the forward purchase shares. In the event of any such failure to fund by Samsara
BioCapital or any forward transferees, any obligation is so terminated or any such condition is not satisfied and not waived by
such party, we may not be able to obtain additional funds to account for such shortfall on terms favorable to us or at all. Any
such shortfall would also reduce the amount of funds that we have available for working capital of the post-business combination

initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase
shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law
and Nasdaq rules. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage
in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust
account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such
stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not
to exercise its redemption rights.</P>

stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required
to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares
in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination
or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount
of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.
Any such purchases of our shares of Class A common stock may result in the completion of our initial business combination that
may not otherwise have been possible. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the
Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See &ldquo;Proposed Business&thinsp;-&thinsp;Permitted
purchases of our securities&rdquo; for a description of how our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their
affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares of Class A common stock from in any private transaction.</P>

tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our
compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, such
stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents,
as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe
the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or submit public shares for redemption. For example,
we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold
their shares in &ldquo;street name,&rdquo; to, at the holder&rsquo;s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer
agent, or to deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender
offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the
proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote,
we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption
to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included.
In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials,
as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. See the section of this prospectus entitled &ldquo;Proposed Business&thinsp;-&thinsp;Submitting

of the private placement shares and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this
fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly,
investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our shares will be immediately

in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; around for transactions
with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business
combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement

the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account

other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their

of such loans may be convertible into shares of the post-business combination entity at a price of $10.00 per share at the option
of the lender. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination
because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.
Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our

are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due
to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully
bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the
business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</P>

may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective
target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not
execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust
account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well
as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against
our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims
to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available
to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party&rsquo;s engagement
would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriters of this offering will not execute agreements
with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Examples of possible instances where we
may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise
or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver
or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public
shares, if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption
right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that
were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption
amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due
to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement
of which this prospectus forms a part, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a
third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written
letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the
trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value
of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver
is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations,
nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe
that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able
to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available
for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may
not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with
any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including,
without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in certain money market funds which invest only in direct U.S. Treasury obligations.
While short-term U.S.&nbsp;Treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative
interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open
Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the
United States. In the event of very low or negative yields, the amount of interest income (which we may withdraw to pay income
taxes, if any) would be reduced. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders
are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income. If the balance

Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under

pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidating
distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended
to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party
claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and
an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders
with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or
the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of
the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month
from the closing of this offering in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend
to comply with the foregoing procedures.</P>

280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our
payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our
dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited
to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers,
investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL,
any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro
rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred
after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially
brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received
by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in
the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering is not considered
a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the
imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant
to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption
distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.</P>

can demand that we register their founder shares, after those shares convert to our Class A common stock at the time of our initial
business combination. Pursuant to the forward purchase agreement, we agreed that we will use our commercially reasonable efforts
to file within 30 days after the closing of the initial business combination a registration statement with the SEC for a secondary
offering of the forward purchase shares and to cause such registration statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable
after it is filed. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant
number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.
In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude.
This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for
more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the
common stock owned by our initial stockholders, holders of our forward purchase shares or holders of our working capital loans
or their respective permitted transferees are registered.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Our efforts to identify a prospective initial
business combination target will not be limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic region. While we may pursue an initial
business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify,
acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management team&rsquo;s established global relationships
and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic investments globally
and has done so successfully in a number of sectors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating
a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected
any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks
of any particular target business&rsquo;s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects.
To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations
with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record
of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development
stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,
we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate
time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to
control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment
in our shares will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available,
in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination
could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Healthcare-related companies are generally
subject to greater governmental regulation than most other industries at the U.S. state and federal levels, and internationally.
In recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare
costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and
facilities. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the United States through the Health Care
Reform Act. These laws are intended to increase health insurance coverage through individual and employer mandates, subsidies offered
to lower income individuals, tax credits available to smaller employers and broadening of Medicaid eligibility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">While one intent of healthcare reform is
to expand health insurance coverage to more individuals, it may also involve additional regulatory mandates and other measures
designed to constrain medical costs, including coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services. The Health Care Reform Act has
had a significant impact on the healthcare sector in the U.S. and consequently has the ability to affect the companies within the
healthcare industry. The ultimate effects of federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation, or healthcare initiatives,
if any, on the healthcare sector, whether implemented at the federal or state level, or internationally, cannot be predicted with
certainty and such reform, legislation, regulation or initiatives, including the Health Care Reform Act or any successor legislation,
may adversely affect the performance of a potential business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Changes in governmental policies may have
a material effect on the demand for or costs of certain products and services. A healthcare-related company must receive government
approval before introducing new drugs and medical devices or procedures. This process may delay the introduction of these products
and services to the marketplace, resulting in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage
to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company&rsquo;s revenues
and profitability. Failure to obtain governmental approval of a key drug or device or other regulatory action could have a material
adverse effect on the business of a portfolio company. Additionally, expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers is
subject to &ldquo;determinations of need&rdquo; by the appropriate government authorities. This process not only increases the
time and cost involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth
potential of healthcare-related facilities operators.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Certain healthcare-related companies depend
on the exclusive rights or patents for the products they develop and distribute. Patents have a limited duration and, upon expiration,
other companies may market substantially similar &ldquo;generic&rdquo; products that are typically sold at a lower price than the
patented product, causing the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product,
resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability
of these companies. The profitability of healthcare-related companies may also be affected, among other factors, by restrictions
on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an
increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited product offering, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market
developments. Finally, because the products and services of healthcare-related companies affect the health and well-being of many
individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to product liability lawsuits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The healthcare industry spends heavily
on research and development. Research findings (e.g., regarding side effects or comparative benefits of one or more particular
treatments, services or products) and technological innovation (together with patent expirations) may make any particular treatment,
service or product less attractive if previously unknown or underappreciated risks are revealed, or if a more effective, less costly
or less risky solution is or becomes available. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on the companies that
are target businesses for investment.</P>

a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a
business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination
with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption
rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum
net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide
to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval
of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we do not complete

securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination, the number of shares of Class A common
stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number
of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of shares of Class

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">When evaluating the desirability of effecting
our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business&rsquo;s management
may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business&rsquo;s
management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected.
Should the target business&rsquo;s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public
company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders
who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities.
Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the
reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they
are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as
applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.</P>

an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share.
On October 30, 2020, our sponsor forfeited 1,437,500 founder shares for no consideration such that it now holds 2,875,000 founder
shares. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible.
The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number
of founder shares issued. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size
of this offering would be a maximum of 11,500,000 shares if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full,
and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after this offering. Up to 375,000 of the
founder shares will be forfeited depending on the extent to which the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment is exercised. The founder
shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has committed to purchase
an aggregate of up to 500,000 private placement shares (or up to 530,000 shares if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option
is exercised in full), at a price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,000,000 (or $5,300,000 if the underwriters&rsquo;
over-allotment option is exercised in full). The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence
their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing
the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary
of the closing of this offering nears, which is the deadline for our completion of an initial business combination.</P>

50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient
for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction
that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target
business, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination
company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock
of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
number of new shares of Class A common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority
of our outstanding Class A common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently
combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s shares than we initially
acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target
business.</P>

with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors
prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office
until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our &ldquo;staggered&rdquo;
Board of Directors, only a minority of the Board of Directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because
of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will
continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination. The forward purchase shares will not
be issued until completion of our initial business combination and, accordingly, will not be included in any stockholder vote until
such time.</P>

price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock after this offering constitutes
the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our initial stockholders acquired the founder shares at a nominal
price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon closing of this offering, you and the other public stockholders will incur
an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 86.3% (or $8.63 per share, assuming no exercise of the underwriters&rsquo;
over-allotment option), the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering of $1.37 and
the initial offering price of $10.00 per share. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of
the founder shares result in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion
of the founder shares at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares,
any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive
to our Class A common stock.</P>

forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating
and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event
we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as
a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change
in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations,
to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account
will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $200,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.2%
per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.</TD></TR></TABLE>

of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement shares be deposited in a trust account. Of the $105.0
million in gross proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement shares described in this prospectus,
or $120.3 million if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full, $100.0 million ($10.00 per share), or
$115.0 million if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per share), will be deposited into
a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company acting as trustee, after deducting $2.0 million in underwriting
discounts and commissions payable upon the closing of this offering (or $2.3 million if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment
option is exercised in full) and an aggregate of $1.0 million to pay fees and expenses in connection with the closing of this offering
and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $200,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year; however, we can provide no assurances
regarding this amount.</P>

in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our taxes, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24

may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or the redemption of our public shares,
we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance
or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness
in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements
we may enter into following consummation of this offering. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides
that, following this offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing
additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class
with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the closing of this

will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while
we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business combination, only after we have negotiated
and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our
estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable.
If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.</P>

the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.</P>

costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination,
we may repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used
to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into shares of the post business combination entity
at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination,
we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

closing of our initial business combination. Samsara BioCapital will purchase a number of forward purchase shares, if any, that
we expect will result in gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business combination and pay related
fees and expenses, after first applying amounts available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other financing source obtained by us for such purpose
at or prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed by us and Samsara
BioCapital to be retained by the post-business combination company for working capital or other purposes. Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s
commitment under the forward purchase agreement is subject to, among other conditions, the business combination including the target
assets or business, and the terms of the business combination being reasonably acceptable to Samsara BioCapital.</P>

on September 8, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset

specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions directly
or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement
shares, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase
agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this offering or otherwise), shares issued to
the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.</P>

to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our
initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents
after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has
occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result
of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.
We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We estimate that the net proceeds from
the sale of the shares of Class A stock in this offering and the sale of the private placement shares for an aggregate purchase
price of $5,000,000 (or $5,300,000 if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting offering
expenses of approximately $1,000,000 and underwriting commissions of $2,000,000 (or $2,300,000 if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment
option is exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $3,500,000, or $4,025,000 if the underwriters&rsquo;
over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $102,000,000 (or $117,000,000 if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option
is exercised in full) (assuming no redemptions and assuming no funding under the forward purchase agreement). $100,000,000 (or
$115,000,000 if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be held in the trust account, which includes
the deferred underwriting commissions described above. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. The remaining approximately $2,000,000
will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such
excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust
account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate
of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.</P>

funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting
commissions), and the proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares, if any, to complete our initial business combination.
We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares of our
common stock authorized and outstanding after the completion of this offering, to be $200,000, which is the maximum amount of annual
franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may pay from funds from this offering held outside
of the trust account or from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and released to us for this purpose. Our annual
income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account.
We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that
our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds
held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make
other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.</P>

additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial
business combination. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence
and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds
available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain
of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use
a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account
would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into shares of the post business combination
entity at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will
be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.</P>

regulatory reporting requirements; $75,000 for Nasdaq and other regulatory fees; $75,000 for consulting, travel and miscellaneous
expenses incurred during the search for a business combination target; and approximately $155,000 for general working capital that
will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. We will also pay (i) the Jiya management approximately $495,000 for base
salaries annually for their services prior to the business combination and (ii) our sponsor or an affiliate up to $10,000 per month

It invests in both public and private biopharmaceutical companies across all financing rounds from seed to crossover to initial
public offering, private investments in public equity (PIPEs) and follow-on offerings. It is agnostic with respect to development
stage and therapeutic area with current investments ranging from an early-stage incubator, focused on facilitating the advancement

Graphite Bio and Tentarix Biotherapeutics. Samsara has also been instrumental in the creation of an early stage incubator called
Autobahn Labs. Autobahn Labs collaborates with scientists at leading academic institutions to accelerate the translation of scientific
ideas to novel therapeutics.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">The last decade has seen unprecedented innovation
in the biopharmaceutical industry, including the introduction of a multitude of new therapies for serious diseases and the establishment
of new therapeutic modalities. These innovations have resulted in significant advances for clinicians and patients, and markedly
improved the outcomes for patients suffering from a wide range of diseases. Among the most significant advances during this period
was the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents that leverage a patient&rsquo;s immune system to fight their disease. These
medications have become the backbone treatment for many cancers and were led by the approvals by the U.S. FDA of Yervoy (2011)
and Keytruda (2014). In the years since the first approvals, a number of additional agents have been approved and a large number
are currently in clinical trials. In 2013, a functional cure for patients suffering from specific types of the hepatitis C virus
was approved by the U.S. FDA. The industry also saw the first cell and gene therapy products approved by the U.S. FDA this decade,
with the approval and launches of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for cancer and gene therapies for a genetic form
of blindness and spinal muscular atrophy (&ldquo;SMA&rdquo;), an orphan disease characterized by neuromuscular issues and early
death.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">These new medicines and modalities represent
the culmination of decades of basic science research and significant advances in our understanding of disease pathophysiology as
well as the advancement in manufacturing techniques for these new therapeutic approaches. The advances in our understanding of
the underlying causes of disease have been facilitated by significant improvements in the cost, speed, and accuracy of tools that
allow researchers to identify the specific genetic, genomic, and cellular aberrations associated with disease. This has enabled
better identification of biological targets as well as facilitated broader use of biomarkers as surrogate biological indicators
of efficacy in clinical development, allowing researchers to refine and enhance clinical trial designs, and direct treatments to
the patients that will benefit most.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">This innovation has been supported, and indeed
accelerated, by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. FDA which have utilized a number of tools to catalyze the introduction of new
medicines to physicians and patients. The U.S. FDA, and similar agencies in other territories, has established a number of regulatory
tools that allow biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate the drug development process and the advancement of new therapies to
patients. These regulatory tools include orphan drug designation which provides defined regulatory exclusivity for products targeting
under 200,000 patients in the U.S., fast track designation which decreases the FDA review time from 10 months to 6 months, accelerated
approval which allows for the approval of new medicines based on surrogate markers of efficacy, priority review and breakthrough
designation which provides additional access and interaction to the FDA for diseases with high unmet medical needs. From 2014 to
2019, the U.S. FDA approved 261 new molecular entities (NMEs), with 46% of approvals receiving orphan drug designation, 65% receiving
priority review, 15% receiving accelerated approval, and 26% designated as breakthrough therapies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">Largely based on the confluence of scientific
innovation, regulatory alignment and patient need, the pace of private company formation as well as IPOs has been very strong.
From 2018 to 2019, there were over 850 private biopharmaceutical financing rounds in the U.S. and EU raising over $32 billion in
proceeds. During the same period, there were 99 biopharmaceutical IPOs in the US and EU raising over $12 billion in proceeds. Despite
the recent volume of IPOs, the process of &ldquo;going public&rdquo; is replete with myriad challenges that are specific to the
biopharmaceutical industry and results in significant inefficiencies in the biopharmaceutical equity markets. This includes the
need for a private biotech company management team to assemble their own syndicate of sophisticated investors who are able to understand
the complex scientific, clinical and regulatory factors needed for creating successful medicines. We believe that key to the successful
growth and maturation of a biopharmaceutical company is to reduce its cost of capital, diversify its shareholder base, and increase
its visibility in the broader healthcare ecosystem through access to the public markets. The additional capital available in the
public markets allows companies to advance products through more advanced stages of the drug development and regulatory process,
and potentially to eventual commercialization, leading to significant value inflections in their market capitalization and shareholder
returns.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">We believe that this universe of private
companies is fertile ground for accessing the public markets via a business combination with our company. In addition to existing
private companies, large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies continue to evolve their therapeutic focus and strategies leading
to rationalization of their product portfolios. We believe that this pool of rationalized assets also represents an attractive
pool of acquisition candidates. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage these market inefficiencies to identify high
value assets that are under appreciated by the broader investment community. Our management team and Board, combined with Samsara&rsquo;s
expertise, network and premier deal flow, provide us with unparalleled visibility across all stages of biopharmaceutical companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 24pt">The biopharmaceutical industry has also benefited
significantly from a continued need for larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to build their pipelines of drugs via
mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). There are many drivers of M&amp;A activity in the biopharmaceutical industry, including significant
loss of revenues due to patent expirations and the need to access next generation technologies to drive future growth. Since the
beginning of 2017, there have been over 80 M&amp;A transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry with transaction value greater
than $500 million each, resulting in a cumulative M&amp;A volume of nearly $500 billion. Industry analysts predict that M&amp;A
activity is expected to continue as biopharmaceutical companies continue to face patent expirations and depend on acquisitions
to drive innovation and growth. Since 2019, there have been a number of M&amp;A transactions in the biopharmaceutical industry
with transaction value greater than $1 billion. A few recent examples include Bristol-Myers Squibb&rsquo;s acquisition of Celgene
for $74 billion, Eli Lilly&rsquo;s acquisition of LOXO Oncology for $8 billion, and Gilead&rsquo;s acquisition of Forty Seven for
$4.9 billion. In addition, recently announced M&amp;A transactions with transaction value greater than $1 billion that recently
closed or may soon close include Sanofi&rsquo;s acquisition of Principia Biopharma for $3.7 billion, Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s
acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals for $6.5 billion, Gilead&rsquo;s acquisition of Immunomedics for $21 billion and Illumina&rsquo;s
acquisition of GRAIL for $8 billion and Bristol Myers Squibb&rsquo;s acquisition of MyoKardia for $13 billion.</P>

purchase of up to 2,500,000 forward purchase shares in a private placement that may close simultaneously with the closing of our
initial business combination. Samsara BioCapital&rsquo;s commitment under the forward purchase agreement is subject to, among other
conditions, the business combination (including the target assets or business, and the terms of the business combination) being
reasonably acceptable to Samsara BioCapital. This purchase will be eligible to be made regardless of whether any shares of Class
A common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders. The forward purchase shares will be issued only in connection with the
closing of the initial business combination. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase shares, if any, may be used as part
of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination
or for working capital in the post-transaction company. See &ldquo;&mdash;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.&rdquo;</P>

one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the
trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors will
make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to
independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent
investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market
value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of
a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target&rsquo;s assets or prospects.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We anticipate structuring our initial business
combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity
interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that
the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet
certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business
combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns
or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange
for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target.
However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business
combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than
100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company,
the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80%
of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test
will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.</P>

materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or

their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination,
whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such
shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive
officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on a negotiated
price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply
with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates
will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange

subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination
as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or
on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">As described above, we intend to require
our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &ldquo;street
name,&rdquo; to, at the holder&rsquo;s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares
to our transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system,
prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this
date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition,
if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of
its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in
which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable,
that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether
we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to
two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send
out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it
wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures
disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise
period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">There is a nominal cost associated with
the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent
will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker
whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we
require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement
of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Any request to redeem such shares, once
made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore,
if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides
prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return
the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares
electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.</P>

in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.
However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001.

Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision

service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders,
there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented
from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility
or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage
with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute
an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives
are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third
party&rsquo;s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances
where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular
expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute
a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters of this
offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is
no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any
negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to
protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims
by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into
a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of
funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party
or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or
not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such
indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
obligations and we believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you
that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the
trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per
public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser
amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for
claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether
to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent
directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible
that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly,

claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and
an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders

statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three
years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from

However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching
for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment

we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business
execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any
claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the
extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such
lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">We have entered into an offer letter with
Ms. Hemrajani, our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which Ms. Hemrajani has agreed to provide up to 60% of her normal working
time to the Company in her capacity as Chief Executive Officer. In connection with her services, Ms. Hemrajani will receive an
annual base salary of $270,000 and will be eligible to participate in the Company&rsquo;s benefit programs in effect from time
to time. In addition, Ms. Hemrajani will receive a grant of 200,000 Class B shares from our sponsor, which will vest 25% on the
first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining 75% vesting in equal monthly installments over 36 months, in each case,
subject to Ms. Hemrajani&rsquo;s continued employment with the Company. The Class B shares will be subject to the same terms and
conditions as the Class B shares held by our sponsor. Ms. Hemrajani&rsquo;s offer letter also provides that, in the event Ms. Hemrajani&rsquo;s
employment is terminated by the Company without &ldquo;cause&rdquo; or Ms. Hemrajani resigns for &ldquo;good reason&rdquo; (such
terms are defined in the offer letter), then Ms. Hemrajani will be entitled to receive (i) base salary continuation and payment
of monthly COBRA premiums, in each case for three months following the date of her termination and (ii) an additional three months
of vesting for purposes of her Class B shares (or, if such termination of employment occurs prior to August 24, 2021, acceleration
of 25% of her Class B shares). Payment of the severance benefits is contingent on Ms. Hemrajani&rsquo;s execution and non-revocation
of a release of claims, as a well as her continued compliance with customary confidentiality and non-solicitation restrictions
set forth in her offer letter. In addition, in the event Ms. Hemrajani is not offered a position as an executive officer of the
target business following the initial business combination, then 100% of Ms. Hemrajani&rsquo;s Class B shares will become fully
vested.</P>

an acquisition opportunity jointly with our Sponsor, or one or more of its affiliates, which we refer to as an &ldquo;Affiliated
Joint Acquisition.&rdquo; Such entities may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination,
or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked
securities. For example, we entered into a forward purchase agreement with Samsara BioCapital pursuant to which Samsara BioCapital
agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to 2,500,000 forward purchase shares, for $10.00 per share, or an aggregate maximum amount
of $25,000,000, in a private placement that may close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. Samsara
BioCapital&rsquo;s commitment under the forward purchase agreement is subject to, among other conditions, the business combination
(including the target assets or business, and the terms of the initial business combination) being reasonably acceptable to Samsara
BioCapital. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future, may have additional fiduciary or contractual
obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination
opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity
which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor
his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. We do not believe, however, that
the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our
business combination. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer
or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time
of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such entity
a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce
our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such
person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually
permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. In addition, the Company and its affiliates, including
our officers and directors who are affiliated with the Company, may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours
during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts
of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect
our ability to complete our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">On September 9, 2020, our sponsor purchased
an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share.
On October 30, 2020, our sponsor forfeited 1,437,500 founder shares for no consideration such that it now holds 2,875,000 founder
shares. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible.
The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number
of founder shares issued. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size
of this offering would be a maximum of 11,500,000 shares if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full,
and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after this offering. Up to 375,000 of the
founder shares will be forfeited depending on the extent to which the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment is exercised. The post-offering
percentages in the following table assume that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, that our initial stockholders
have forfeited 375,000 founder shares and that there are 13,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding after this offering.
The post-offering percentages do not reflect the transfer by our sponsor of 30,000 of our Class B common stock that we expect to
transfer to each of our independent directors prior to the consummation of this offering.</P>

However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf

officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete
an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not
close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds
from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into shares of the post
business combination entity at a price of $10.00 per share at the option of the lender. Except as set forth above, the terms of
such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion
of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account. Any of the foregoing payments to our sponsor, repayments of loans from our sponsor or
repayments of working capital loans prior to our initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account.</P>

will adopt a policy setting forth the policies and procedures for its review and approval or ratification of &ldquo;related party
transactions.&rdquo; A &ldquo;related party transaction&rdquo; is any consummated or proposed transaction or series of transactions:
(i) in which the company was or is to be a participant; (ii) the amount of which exceeds (or is reasonably expected to exceed)
the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of the company&rsquo;s total assets at year end for the prior two completed fiscal
years in the aggregate over the duration of the transaction (without regard to profit or loss); and (iii) in which a &ldquo;related
party&rdquo; had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. &ldquo;Related parties&rdquo; under this policy will
include: (i) our directors, nominees for director or executive officers; (ii) any record or beneficial owner of more than 5% of
any class of our voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing if the foregoing person is a natural
person; and (iv) any other person who maybe a &ldquo;related person&rdquo; pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act. Pursuant to the policy, the audit committee will consider (i) the relevant facts and circumstances of each related party transaction,
including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm&rsquo;s-length dealings with an unrelated
third party, (ii) the extent of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction, (iii) whether the transaction contravenes
our code of ethics or other policies, (iv) whether the audit committee believes the relationship underlying the transaction to
be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders and (v) the effect that the transaction may have on a director&rsquo;s
status as an independent member of the board and on his or her eligibility to serve on the board&rsquo;s committees. Management
will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating
thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction
in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate
in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party.</P>

of common stock, $0.0001 par value each, including 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Class B

law. Unless specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or as required by applicable provisions of the
DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of common stock that are voted is required
to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which will
generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting
with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election
of directors can elect all of the directors. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared

A common stock which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our stockholders vote on the business combination to the extent
we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors is divided into three
classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior

the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws, unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such
a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business
combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore,

with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two
business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject
to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The
per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting
commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public
shares they hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Unlike many special purpose acquisition
companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and
provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote
is not required by law, if a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business
or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant
to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial
and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC&rsquo;s proxy
rules. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for
business or other legal reasons, we will, like many special purpose acquisition companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction
with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of
our initial business combination. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates
in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our initial business
combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business
combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, non-votes will have no
effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained.</P>

any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo;
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares,
without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including
Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our stockholders&rsquo; inability to redeem the Excess Shares will
reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such stockholders could suffer a material
loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption
distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders
will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their
shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.</P>

shares and private placement shares they hold and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial
business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders&rsquo; founder shares and shares of Class A common stock
issued as part of the private placement shares, we would need only 3,500,001, or 35%, of the 10,000,000 public shares sold in this
offering (or 4,047,501 or 35.20% of the 11,500,000 public shares sold in this offering in the event the over-allotment is exercised
in full) to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming

party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B)
which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of
Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of
Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. If an action is brought
outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder&rsquo;s
counsel. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in
the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is
enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders
will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.</P>

U.S. federal income tax on a portion of our income if we were determined to be a &ldquo;personal holding company,&rdquo; or PHC,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a PHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes
in a given taxable year if (i) at any time during the last half of such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard
to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations,
pension funds and charitable trusts) own or are deemed to own (pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules) directly or indirectly
more than 50% of the stock of the corporation by value and (ii) at least 60% of the corporation&rsquo;s adjusted ordinary gross
income, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for such taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among
other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">At least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross
income may consist of PHC income, depending on the date and size of our initial business combination. In addition, depending on
the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals, including the members of our sponsor and certain tax-exempt organizations,
pension funds and charitable trusts, more than 50% of our stock may be owned or deemed owned (pursuant to the constructive ownership
rules) by such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given that we will not be a PHC following
this offering or in the future. If we are or were to become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional
PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed PHC income, which generally includes our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments.</P>

respect to shares of our Class A common stock, those distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income
tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will
be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) your adjusted tax basis in our Class A common stock. Any remaining excess will
be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Class A common stock and will be treated as described under

that we pay to you generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With
certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction
limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends that
we pay to you may constitute &ldquo;qualified dividends&rdquo; that will be subject to tax at the maximum tax rate accorded to
long-term capital gains. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Class A common stock described in this
prospectus may prevent a U.S. holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received
deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be. If the holding period requirements are
not satisfied, then if you are a corporation you may not be able to qualify for the dividends received deduction and would have
taxable income equal to the entire dividend amount, and if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, you may be subject to tax on the
dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead of the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income.</P>

which, in general, would include a redemption of Class A common stock that is treated as a sale of that stock as described below,
and including as a result of a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination within
the required time period, you generally will recognize capital gain or loss as described below. This capital gain or loss generally
will be long-term capital gain or loss if your holding period for the Class A common stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term
capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations.</P>

A common stock generally will equal your acquisition cost increased by prior amounts received in redemption of Class A Common Stock

In the event that your Class A common stock is redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under
the section of this prospectus entitled &ldquo;Description of Securities&mdash;Common Stock&rdquo; or if we purchase your Class
A common stock in an open market transaction, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend
on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Class A common stock under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies
as a sale of common stock, you will be treated as described under &ldquo;&mdash;Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other
Taxable Disposition of Class A Common Stock&rdquo; above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of common stock, you will
be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under &ldquo;&mdash;Taxation of Distributions.&rdquo;
Whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held
by you relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Class A common stock generally
will be treated as a sale of the Class A common stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (i) is &ldquo;substantially
disproportionate&rdquo; with respect to you, (ii) results in a &ldquo;complete termination&rdquo; of your interest in us or (iii)
is &ldquo;not essentially equivalent to a dividend&rdquo; with respect to you. These tests are explained more fully below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In determining whether any of the foregoing
tests are satisfied, you take into account not only stock actually owned by you, but also shares of our stock that are constructively
owned by you. You may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities
in which you have an interest or that have an interest in you, as well as any stock you have a right to acquire by exercise of
an option. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and
constructively owned by you immediately following the redemption of Class A common stock must, among other requirements, be less
than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by you immediately before the redemption.
Prior to our initial business combination, the Class A common stock may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose and, consequently,
this substantially disproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of your interest if either
(i) all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by you are redeemed or (ii) all of the shares of our stock
actually owned by you</P>

of your proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction of your proportionate interest
in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a
small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no
control over corporate affairs may constitute such a &ldquo;meaningful reduction.&rdquo; You should consult your own tax adviser

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in"><I>Taxation of Distributions</I>. In general,
any distributions we make to you on our Class A common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and
profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and, provided they are not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States, tax will be
withheld from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless you are eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax
under an applicable income tax treaty and provide proper certification of your eligibility for that reduced rate (usually on an
IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E). Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero)
your adjusted tax basis in your shares of our Class A common stock and, to the extent the distribution exceeds your adjusted tax
basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the Class A common stock, which will be treated as described under
&ldquo;&mdash;Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Common Stock&rdquo; below. In addition, if
we determine that we are likely to be classified as a &ldquo;U.S. real property holding corporation&rdquo; (see &ldquo;&mdash;Gain
on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Common Stock&rdquo; below), we will endeavor to use reasonable
efforts to determine if we must withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">The 30% withholding does not apply to dividends
paid to you that are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required
by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by you in the United
States), although you will generally be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI in order to claim an exemption
from withholding. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if you were a U.S.
resident, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. A Non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected
dividends may also be subject to an additional &ldquo;branch profits tax&rdquo; imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.25in">Provisions commonly referred to as &ldquo;FATCA&rdquo;
impose withholding of 30% on payments of dividends on our Class A common stock to &ldquo;foreign financial institutions&rdquo;
(which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless
various U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests
in or accounts with those entities) have been satisfied by, or an exemption applies to, the payee (typically certified as to by
the delivery of a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E). The IRS has issued proposed regulations (on which taxpayers may rely until
final regulations are issued) that would generally not apply these withholding requirements to gross proceeds from sales or other
disposition proceeds from shares of Class A common stock. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Under certain circumstances,
if you are a Non-U.S. holder, you may be eligible for refunds or credits of such withholding taxes, although you may be required
to file a U.S. federal income tax return in order to claim such refunds or credits. You should consult your tax adviser regarding
the effects of FATCA on your investment in our common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">We have audited the
accompanying balance sheet of Jiya Acquisition Corp. (formerly known as SMSR Holding Co.) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of September
9, 2020 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder&rsquo;s equity and cash flows for the period from August
27, 2020 (inception) through September 9, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;financial statements&rdquo;).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
September 9, 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August 27, 2020 (inception) through
September 9, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</P>

Concern</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note&nbsp;1
to the financial statements, the Company's ability to execute its business plan is dependent upon its completion of the proposed
initial public offering described in Note&nbsp;3 to the financial statements. The Company has a working capital deficiency as of
September 9, 2020 and lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered
to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans with regard to these matters are also described in Notes&nbsp;1 and
3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&rsquo;s financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules&nbsp;and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">Our audit included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

(formerly known as SMSR Holding Co.) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) was incorporated in Delaware on August 27, 2020. The Company is
a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company is an early

growth companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">As of September 30,
2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from August 27, 2020 (inception) through September
30, 2020 relates to the Company&rsquo;s formation and the proposed initial public offering (&ldquo;Proposed Public Offering&rdquo;),
which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination,
at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the
Proposed Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company&rsquo;s
ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through a Proposed Public Offering of
10,000,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock (the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;) at $10.00 per Public Share (or 11,500,000 Public
Shares if the underwriter&rsquo;s over-allotment option is exercised in full), which is discussed in Note 3, and the sale of 500,000&nbsp;shares
(or up to 530,000 shares if the underwriters&rsquo; over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the &ldquo;Private Placement Shares&rdquo;)
at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Share in a private placement to Jiya Holding Company LLC (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;)
that will close simultaneously with the Proposed Public Offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company&rsquo;s
management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering and
the sale of the Private Placement Shares, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.
The Company must complete a Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the
Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust
Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into an initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or
otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;). Upon the closing of the Proposed
Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.00 per Public Share sold in the Proposed Public Offering,
including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Shares, will be held in a trust account (&ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;),
located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section&nbsp;2(a)(16)
of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out
as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule&nbsp;2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined
by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the
Trust Account, as described below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The Company will provide
its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the &ldquo;public stockholders&rdquo;) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion
of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i)&nbsp;in connection with a stockholder meeting called
to approve the Business Combination or (ii)&nbsp;by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public
stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially
anticipated to be $10.00&nbsp;per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not
previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at redemption
value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo;</P>

with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation
of the Business Combination and, solely if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in
favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder
vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the
&ldquo;Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation&rdquo;), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules&nbsp;of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and file tender offer documents with the SEC containing substantially
the same information as would be included in a proxy statement prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder
approval of the transaction is required</P>

to address this uncertainty through a Proposed Public Offering as discussed in Note 3. There is no assurance that the Company&rsquo;s

growth company,&rdquo; as defined in Section&nbsp;2(a)&nbsp;of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012 (the &ldquo;JOBS Act&rdquo;), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions

the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards
until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not
have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements
that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt
out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time
private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with
another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using
the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company&rsquo;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">Making estimates requires
management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition,
situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates.</P>

the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amount expected to be realized.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 24pt">ASC 740 prescribes a
recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as
of September 30, 2020 and September 9, 2020. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in
significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major
taxing authorities since inception.</P>

computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding

of 375,000 shares of common stock that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters
(see Note 5). At September 30, 2020 and September 9, 2020, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts
that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As
a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented.</P>

LLC, our sponsor, purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 of our Class B common stock, in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000
at an average purchase price of approximately $.0006 per share. On October 30, 2020, our sponsor forfeited 1,437,500 founder shares
for no consideration such that it now holds 2,875,000 founder shares. Such securities were issued in connection with our organization
pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The number of founder shares outstanding
was determined based on the expectation that the total size of this offering would be a maximum of 11,500,000 shares if the underwriters&rsquo;
over-allotment option is exercised in full and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the shares issued in this

is exercised.</P>

withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the

the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the

shares of Common Stock within 45 days from the date of the Prospectus (and as further described in the Prospectus), the Sponsor
agrees to forfeit, at no cost, a number of Founder Shares in the aggregate equal to 375,000 multiplied by a fraction, (i) the numerator
of which is 1,500,000 minus the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Underwriters upon the exercise of their over-allotment
option, and (ii) the denominator of which is 1,500,000. The forfeiture will be adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option
is not exercised in full by the Underwriters so that the Founder Shares will represent an aggregate of 20.0% of the Company&rsquo;s
issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock after the Public Offering (without giving effect to the issuance of Private
Placement Shares (as defined below)). The Sponsor further agrees that to the extent that the size of the Public Offering is increased
or decreased, the Company will purchase or sell shares of Common Stock or effect a share repurchase or share capitalization, as
applicable, immediately prior to the consummation of the Public Offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of the initial
shareholders prior to the Public Offering at 20.0% of its issued and outstanding Capital Shares upon the consummation of the Public
Offering. In connection with such increase or decrease in the size of the Public Offering, then (A) the references to 1,500,000
in the numerator and denominator of the formula in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be changed to a number equal to 15%
of the number of Public Shares issued in the Public Offering and (B) the reference to 375,000 in the formula set forth in the first
sentence of this paragraph shall be adjusted to such number of Founder Shares that the Sponsor would have to surrender to the Company
in order for the initial shareholders to hold an aggregate of 20.0% of the Company&rsquo;s issued and outstanding shares of Class
A Common Stock after the Public Offering.</P>

as any similar securities of the Company included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable
Securities through an Underwritten Offering under this &lrm;Section 2.02(a) shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary

(i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (ii) an exemption from registration available with respect
to such sale. Subscriber agrees that if any transfer of its Shares or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition
precedent to any such transfer, Subscriber may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
Company. Absent registration or available exemption, Subscriber agrees not to resell the Shares. Subscriber further acknowledges
that because the Company is a shell company, Rule 144 may not be available to Subscriber for the resale of the Shares until one
year following consummation of the initial business combination of the Company, despite the release or waiver of any contractual
transfer restrictions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>THIS INDEMNITY AGREEMENT</B> (this &ldquo;<B><I>Agreement</I></B>&rdquo;)
is made as of [&bull;], 2020, by and between Jiya Acquisition Corp., a Delaware Corporation (the &ldquo;<B><I>Company</I></B>&rdquo;),

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, highly competent persons have become more reluctant
to serve publicly-held corporations as directors, officers or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection
through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their
service to and activities on behalf of such corporations;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &ldquo;<B><I>Board</I></B>&rdquo;)
has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis,
at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its Subsidiaries from certain liabilities;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, while the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the
Company provide for the indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company, Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to applicable Delaware law, and the Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the indemnification provisions set forth
therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the board
of directors, officers and other persons with respect to indemnification, hold harmless, exoneration, advancement and reimbursement
rights;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, the uncertainties relating to such insurance
and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, the Board has determined that the increased
difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company&rsquo;s stockholders and
that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for
the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, hold harmless, exonerate and to advance expenses on behalf of, such
persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue
concern that they will not be so protected against liabilities;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0"><B>WHEREAS</B>, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance
of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute
therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder; and</P>

shall be selected as provided in this Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>12(b).
The Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board),
and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected and
certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of &ldquo;Independent Counsel&rdquo; as defined in Section
<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>2 of this Agreement. If the Independent
Counsel is selected by the Board, the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the
Independent Counsel so selected and certifying that the Independent Counsel so selected meets the requirements of &ldquo;Independent
Counsel&rdquo; as defined in Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>2
of this Agreement. In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within ten (10) days after such written
notice of selection shall have been received, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection
to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected
does not meet the requirements of &ldquo;Independent Counsel&rdquo; as defined in Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>2
of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and
timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated,
the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court
of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after submission by
Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>11(b)
hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the
Delaware Court for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other&rsquo;s selection
of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Delaware Court, and the person
with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>(a)
hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif; font-size: 10pt"><B>&lrm;</B></FONT>14(a)
of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject

of this investment until the Shares are sold pursuant to: (i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (ii)
an exemption from registration available with respect to such sale. Subscriber is able to bear the economic risk of an investment
in the Shares for an indefinite period of time and to afford a complete loss of Subscriber&rsquo;s investment in the Shares.</P>

the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act, and Subscriber understands that the certificates or book-entries representing
the Shares will contain a legend or notation in respect of such restrictions. If, in the future, Subscriber decides to offer, resell,
pledge or otherwise transfer the Shares, such Shares may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only pursuant to:
(i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (ii) an exemption from registration available with respect
to such sale. Subscriber agrees that if any transfer of its Shares or any interest therein is proposed to be made, as a condition
precedent to any such transfer, Subscriber may be required to deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
Company. Absent registration or available exemption, Subscriber agrees not to resell the Shares. Subscriber further acknowledges
that because the Company is a shell company, Rule 144 may not be available to Subscriber for the resale of the Shares until one
year following consummation of the initial business combination of the Company, despite the release or waiver of any contractual
transfer restrictions.</P>

                                         of Section 409A, your right to receive any installment payments pursuant to this Offer
                                         Letter shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments.
                                         Whenever a payment under this Offer Letter specifies a payment period with reference
                                         to a number of days, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be
                                         within the sole discretion of the Company or one of its subsidiaries. The Company cannot
                                         make any guarantees with respect to compliance with such requirements, and neither the
                                         Company nor any affiliate will have any obligation to indemnify you or otherwise hold
                                         you harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties. To the extent necessary to comply
                                         with Section 409A, if the period during which you have discretion to execute or to revoke
                                         the release of claims described in Section 9 straddles two of your taxable years, then
                                         the Company will provide the Severance Benefits starting in the second of such taxable
                                         years, regardless of in which taxable year your actually delivers the executed release
                                         to the Company. To the extent you are a &ldquo;specified employee&rdquo; within the meaning
                                         of Section 409A as of the date of termination of your employment, no amounts payable
                                         under this Offer Letter that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section

                                         before the date which is the first day of the seventh month after such date of termination
                                         of employment (the &ldquo;<B><I>Delayed Payment Date</I></B>&rdquo;) or, if earlier,
                                         the date of your death following such separation from service. All such amounts that
                                         would, but for the preceding sentence become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date
                                         will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The words &ldquo;include,&rdquo; &ldquo;includes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;including&rdquo;

construed to include any other gender, and words in the singular form will be construed to include the plural and vice versa, unless
the context otherwise requires. The words &ldquo;this Agreement,&rdquo; &ldquo;herein,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereof,&rdquo; &ldquo;hereby,&rdquo;

expressly so limited. The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein will have independent
significance. If any party hereto has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact
that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
